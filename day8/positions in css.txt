To place an element in a specific position on the web page we are going to use position properties 
which carries
1. Static       --> Default value for every element
2. Relative     --> Which changes the position of an element placed on screen.
3. Absolute     --> Which changes the position of an element based on its parent element which carries relative or fixed or sticky 
4. Sticky       --> Which holds the element only after mentioning the position
